# Todo-app-english-norwegian

This webapp is using vanilla javascript, css and html... And it should work on mobile and desktop.

For css I used grid layout and imported a font, which is in the assets/fonts folder.

I also used localstorage for the todos, which generates the todos when the page refreshes(DOM is loaded). The id is saved
in local storage and is incrementing one at a time, to ceep the list of todos in the correct order.

You can also delete all todos, which means you delete them in local storage and refreshes the page.

I have two language versions. It checks your browser language and outputs the language(eigher norwegian or default english).
