# Todo-app-norwegian
The code is english, but text is norwegian. Using javascript, css and html... This thing should work on mobile and desktop.

For css I used grid layout and imported a font, which is in the assets/fonts folder.

For generating unique id's (for deleting a todo) i used a random number(thousands). This might be a weakness when dealing 
with a big number of todos but for the purpose of this webapp is not to store a big amount of todos.

I also used localstorage for the todos, which generates the todos when the page refreshes(DOM is loaded).

If you want to split up code in unique files feel free to do so.
