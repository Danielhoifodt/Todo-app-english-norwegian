# Todo-app-norwegian
The code is english, but text is norwegian. Using javascript, css and html... This thing should work on mobile and desktop.

For css I used grid layout and imported a font, which is in the assets/fonts folder.

I also used localstorage for the todos, which generates the todos when the page refreshes(DOM is loaded). The id is saved
in local storage and is incrementing one at a time. To ceep the list of todos in the correct order.

If you want to split up code in unique files feel free to do so.
