# Todo-app-norwegian
Code is english, but text is norwegian. Using javascript, css and html... This thing should work on mobile and desktop.

For css used grid and imported a font, which is in the assets/fonts folder.

For generating unique id's (for deleting a todo) i used a javascrpt random number(thousands).

If you want to slit up code in unique files feel free to do so.
